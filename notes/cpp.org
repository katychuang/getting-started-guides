Prior to Fall 2017 the CIS department at Brooklyn College introductory programming courses were taught in C++. Since Fall 2017 the department is based on Java 8. 

With any programming language, the best thing one can do for productivity is to keep documentation links handy.

** Hello World example

#+BEGIN_SRC C++
#include <iostream>

		int main(){
				std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
				return 0;
		}
#+END_SRC

**** Variables
Variables can be declared, initialized, or assigned.

- Declared means specifying a data type and variable name.
- Initialize means giving a value to the variable name.
- Assignment is a combination of both declaration and initialized in one sentence.

**** Built-in (Primitive) Data Types
*Integer Data Types*

#+CAPTION: Integer Data Types
#+attr_html: :class zebra-striping sane-table

| Data Type          | Typical Size | Typical Range |
|--------------------+---------------+---------------|
| short int          | 2 bytes       |               |
| unsigned short int | 2 bytes       |               |
| int                | 4 bytes       |               |
| unsigned int       | 4 bytes       |               |


*Floating-Point Data Type*
| Data Type             | Key word     | Typical Range                                  |
|-----------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------|
| single precision      | float        | 4 bytes. Numbers between -3.4E-38 and +3.4E-38 |
| double precision      | double       | 8 bytes.                                       |
| long double precision | long double* | 8 bytes.                                       |

** Compiling C++ by Command Line

To compile C++ source code on the command line, it is with this command where ~main.cpp~ is your filename. The ~g++~ command refers to the GNU C++ Compiler program. There are other implmentations of the C++ compiler beyond theones released by GNU, however this guide only references g++.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
g++ main.cpp
#+END_SRC

followed by running the executable generated with

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./main
#+END_SRC

** Installing GNU G++
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: install-gcc
:EXPORT_TITLE:  Installing GNU C Compiler (GCC)
:END:
On linux (i.e. Ubuntu)
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# update package index
sudo apt update

# install the Development Tools packages
sudo apt install build-essential

# to install manual pages
sudo apt-get install manpages-dev

# verify g++ isntalled with the following command
g++ --version
#+END_SRC

| Thread        | model:                                      | posix   |        |                       |

** BC Students can use the WEB Lab Server to compile and run C++98 code.

Use a terminal friendly app to connect to the server via ssh. A sample command is as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ssh username@hostname
#+END_SRC

After entering your password, create a directory for your assignment, such as ~mkdir folder1~ and then you can use a command line such as vim, emacs, or nano to edit the file.

*** You can get your linux server account information from the W.E.B. Computing lab

You can email the Linux Administrator, Raymond Patitucci or visit their location at
