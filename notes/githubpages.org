* What is Github Pages?

* How to make your home page

When you use GitHub pages, you can access your website at the url http://username.github.io and the underlying files would be found in your repository, which can be found at url pattern ttp://github.com/username/username.github.io

This section walks you through step by step.

*Short version:*
1. Create a repo of name: *yourusername*.github.io
2. Go to that repo's settings and check the box for your pages (note the drop down option selected)
3. Add .html files to your repo

You should be able to access your website from ~http://yourusername.github.io~

*Longer version:*
1. From your account, create a new repo following the structure username.github.io -- this is the basis for producing a website hosted by github pages (https://pages.github.com/).
2. Confirm that the pages feature is turned on for that repository, under the settings menu.
3. This allows you to host files under your GitHub account.
    a. You could use the github.com web interface to upload each file individually, however I recommended you take time at some point in your career to gain familiarity with the workflow of using git commands from your machine terminal.
    b. Upload the images and html files to that repo.
4. If set up properly you should be able to access your website from http://username.github.io

* Using Jekyll Static Site Generator

Github Pages recognizes files that are formatted to the Jekyll Static Site Generated fraemwork. Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/) is written in the Ruby programming language, it convers text files in markdown format into HTML pages.

Static HTML pages means that it's an HTML page that doesn't change when you view it across different timestaps. As in, static is /not/ a script generated page. The contents do not change because you pull data from a database. A page like that would be considered /dynamic/ because the contents can change.
