Regular expression "regex" is a particular notation used for pattern matching on strings. For example, when entering in email addresses and passwords into form input fields, you can use regex to specify the conditions that the text must match.

Regex is also frequently used in text parsing, compiler design, and web scraping amongst other applications.
