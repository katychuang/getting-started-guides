      <description>General Advice when solving problems
 Understand the problem being asked Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to handle edge cases Expressing your answer is just as important as understanding the problem, and solving it!  Problems with Stacks #    Checking parenthesis #  Examples:
Input: ()Output: trueInput: ()[]{}Output: trueInput: ([)]Output: falseInput: {[]}Output: trueInput : {[]{()}}Output : trueInput : [{}{}(]Output :falseThe logic here is to push a new item on to a stack when we notice an input with an opener, and pop when there is a closer.</description>

      <description>A website is rendered in a web browser through the HTTP Protocol. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more one should learn about Internet Protocols, but it&amp;rsquo;s not required to get an operational understanding of working with websites.
Web Design Principles
The page that is rendered by the web browser is formatted in Hypertext Markup Language or HTML for short. HTML is a set of nested tags that describe how the page should be structured.</description>

      <description>What are Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)? #  This is a diagram that maps out the flow of information for any system. There are defined symbols like rectangles, circles, arrows, and so on to distinguish different parts of the system.
There are different kinds of data flow diagrams as well, most are separated into either logical DFD or Physical DFD. Logical data flow diagrams focuses on the system process(es). Physical data flow diagrams show how the data flow is implemented in the system.</description>

      <description>Building a website follows many of the principles of building a software application, which includes figuring out what to build ,managing the building, and validating the quality of the final product. In software development this specifica refers to various phases of structured activities such as planning (such as gathering spec requirements), scheduling the work, development, and test. The name for this set of phases is called Software development lifecycle (SDLC). Some of these phases are described below.</description>

      <description>This section focuses on the process, concepts, and tools for building any type of web site or web application. A website has a lot of overlapping functionality and technology as a web application, except it doesn&amp;rsquo;t focus on high volume of dynamism and user interactivity, which would require a database. This article mentions the two interchangeable. However, if one were precise, this article focuses on websites.</description>

      <description>Project based thinking #  Programmers are typically learning to write source code to build programs not just scripts. A programming project requires far more than just fluency with a particular programming language syntax to cohesively put together.
Creating a program requires certain executive functioning skills to coordinate and manage. This guide provides some advice and items to consider include when sharing your codebase. It is not meant to be followed religiously, but instead to provide a framework to guide your approach.</description>

      <description>Git #  Version control systems are used in managing revision control of project artifacts, and maintaining a history of changes to each artifact. Artifacts can include documents, source code, and much more.
Motivations for Source Version Control
 Keeping track of code Storing versions of code changes Restoring previous versions Reviewing work history Collaborating in a group Backup There are two main approaches to version control management systems. That is, they can either be centralized, or decentralized repositories.</description>

 The Java platform includes a collections framework. A collection is an object that represents a group of objects (such as the classic Vector class). A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections, enabling collections to be manipulated independently of implementation details.
 Object-Oriented Fundamentals #  It would be helpful to remember that because is using the Java programming language, which is an object oriented programming language, these collections use the data abstraction concepts such as inheritance to make it possible to be used.</description>

      <description>Introduction #  In the day to day work of programming, one often finds that a large fraction of time is spent looking for certain files. One of the wise adages with managing an assortment of files is to provide an organization scheme to make it easier to find what you need again. It not only helps you as the maintainer, but also helps your reader(s)** and collaborator(s) as well. This is a good habit to devleop before you find yourself managing hundreds of files.</description>
