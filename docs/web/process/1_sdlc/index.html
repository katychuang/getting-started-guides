In software development this specifica refers to various phases of structured activities such as planning (such as gathering spec requirements), scheduling the work, development, and test.</p>

  Requirements Gathering- What&rsquo;s the purpose of the website?
  <a class="anchor" href="#requirements-gathering-what-s-the-purpose-of-the-website">#</a>
</h2>
<p>It helps to know what you&rsquo;re building before you begin building.</p>
<p>Deciding what to build should come from a review of similar websites, as well as discussions with the appropriate stakeholders. For example, if you&rsquo;re building a website for an organization, you shoul devaluate websites from similar organizations, and also speak with the organization.</p>
<p>This is the chance to gather information about the project goals and/or needs, and any must have items. The outcome of this step is a rough list. In the next phase during design, you will further refine the  requirements.</p>
<h2 id="design-specifications-what-are-you-going-to-build-it-with-and-how">
  Design / Specifications - What are you going to build it with and how?
  <a class="anchor" href="#design-specifications-what-are-you-going-to-build-it-with-and-how">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Once you have the general requirements scoped out, it needs to be translated to technical specifications. This includes picking the technologies such the programming language(s), any libraries or frameworks, and so forth. This can also include the stage of creating wireframes, data flow diagrams, and other sketches to describe a roadmap.</p>
<h2 id="scheduling-when-will-it-get-completed">
  Scheduling - When will it get completed?
  <a class="anchor" href="#scheduling-when-will-it-get-completed">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Once you figure out what needs to be built with what technology, you need to figure out when you will complete each feature. It helps to make a list of goals for regular intervals, such as weekly. You should keep in mind of any major events or holidays that might cause disruptions, and include them into your plan.</p>
<p>Some teams prefer an <em>agile</em> approach, which means getting a quick prototype produced. Then using that to collect user feedback to guide prioritization of features for future</p>
<h2 id="building">
  Building
  <a class="anchor" href="#building">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This is the execution of the schedule. If you planned well and made the right choices, it will be fairly easy to execute on. One can easily become discouraged during this phase when the project pace doesn&rsquo;t match the scheduled expectations.  It takes a lot of experience to know how to pick the right tool(s) for the job, and estimate tasks accurately, so take all the hiccups in stride as learning experiences.</p>
<h2 id="testing-does-it-work-as-expected">
  Testing - Does it work as expected?
  <a class="anchor" href="#testing-does-it-work-as-expected">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Once you have built your website, be sure to test it. Make a checklist based on the requirements and/or specifications to compare against the item built. Ensure that the website meets all the requirements.</p>
<h2 id="deployment-delivering-the-software-to-the-client">
  Deployment - Delivering the software to the client
  <a class="anchor" href="#deployment-delivering-the-software-to-the-client">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This is the final stage of the project, when you&rsquo;re ready to deliver the project. With a website this usually means deploying the website to a server.</p>
